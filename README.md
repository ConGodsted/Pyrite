## About
Pyrite helps to fill out your block palette when building with various vanilla blocks! Looking to build with coloured blocks? Try out new Stained Planks, Dyed Lamps or Dyed Bricks in all the dye colours and more! Looking to flex your wealth? Try out Cut, Chiseled and Pillar variants of all the various resource blocks!
