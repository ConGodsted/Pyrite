## About
Pyrite aims to expand on Vanilla's block palette with new wood types, bricks, and more.

It's inspired by mods like Quark and Charm that expand on Minecraft without feeling too unfamiliar.

Pyrite is available for Minecraft Fabric 1.20.1. This is an experimental backport of Pyrite 0.9 to 1.18.2, and should not be considered stable. No Forge port is planned.
